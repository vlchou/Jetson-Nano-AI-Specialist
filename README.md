# Jetson-Nano-AI-Specialist

The code was taken from the "Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano" course on JupyterLab for the classification training. For my project, I decided to create a classification 
tool for identifying different types of USB cables. I have sometimes personally forgot which USB connector is a USB Type A, Type B, and Type C. As a result, this inspired me to
create this classification tool to clearly identify which type of USB cable connector is shown. 

The task is called USBtype because it is identifying which USB type the connector is shown in the camera. The categories are A, B, and C, which represent Type-A, Type-B, and Type-C.
